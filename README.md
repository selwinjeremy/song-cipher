# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## NOTES ON HOW TO IMPLEMENT THE GAME

The first step is to fetch the top 200 songs in America in either Pop or Hip Hop

After this is fetched, select a random song in the category

Store the Artist, Features, Year Released, Album, Top-200 Position, and Producer

Implement a search bar where the user can type in song names and a dropdown list of songs will show

When a song is clicked, match based on above categories

If the user chooses gets the correct value for the category it will be highlighted green

For the artist, it will be highlighted yellow if they are a feature on the song

There will be an up or down arrow beside the year depending on if it came out earlier or later

There will be an up or down arrow depending on if its higher in the top 200 or lower

The user will have 6 attempts to select it.
